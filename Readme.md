## Simon Memory Game

One page JavaScript application based on Simon the game, an electronic memory game 
invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. 
The games creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. 
If the player succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex.
There are two main game modes, the standard and the strict one. If the strict mode
is selected once the user fails, the game is over, whereas with the standard mode
the user can proceed to the next turn even after more wrong attempts.
